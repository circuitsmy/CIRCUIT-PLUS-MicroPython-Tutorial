## ESP32 MicroPython Tutorial

## Getting Started â€“ Installation
Before we start our Micropython tutorial, we need to install some software as prerequisite of this tutorial.

## Prerequisite
* Python 37x or latest - https://www.python.org/downloads/

* Thonny IDE - https://thonny.org/
* MicroPython Firmware - https://thonny.org/

When downloading the file, you will need to rename the file. Since the filename is long and it will be hard for you to type the long name. Rename it simpler as ESP32.
